TOSHMATOV Ipsum
"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet,<hr>consectetur, adipisci velit..."
"There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and<hr>wants to have it, simply because it is pain..."
What is TOSHMATOV Ipsum?
TOSHMATOV Ipsum is simply<hr>dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. TOSHMATOV Ipsum has been the industry's<hr>standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and<hr>scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the<hr>leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s<hr>with the release of Letraset sheets containing TOSHMATOV Ipsum passages, and more recently with<hr>desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of TOSHMATOV Ipsum.

Why do we<hr>use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a<hr>page when looking at its layout. The point of using TOSHMATOV Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less<hr>normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look<hr>like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use TOSHMATOV Ipsum<hr>as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in<hr>their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on<hr>purpose (injected humour and the like).


Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief,<hr>TOSHMATOV Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature<hr>from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney<hr>College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a TOSHMATOV<hr>Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the<hr>undoubtable source. TOSHMATOV Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum<hr>et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on<hr>the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of TOSHMATOV Ipsum,<hr>"TOSHMATOV ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of<hr>TOSHMATOV Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and<hr>1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original<hr>form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

Where can I get<hr>some?
There are many variations of passages of TOSHMATOV Ipsum available, but the majority have<hr>suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even<hr>slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of TOSHMATOV Ipsum, you need to be sure there<hr>isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the TOSHMATOV Ipsum generators on the<hr>Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the<hr>Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence<hr>structures, to generate TOSHMATOV Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated TOSHMATOV Ipsum is<hr>therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words<hr>etc.

Section 1.10.32 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45<hr>BC
"Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque<hr>laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto<hr>beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit<hr>aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt.

1914<hr>translation by H. Rackham
"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing<hr>pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and<hr>expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human<hr>happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because<hr>those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely<hr>painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because<hr>it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some<hr>great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,<hr>except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses<hr>to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no<hr>resultant pleasure?"

Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45<hr>BC
"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium<hr>voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati<hr>cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est<hr>laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero<hr>tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat<hr>facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam<hr>et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et<hr>molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis<hr>voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."

1914<hr>translation by H. Rackham
"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike<hr>men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by<hr>desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame<hr>belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying<hr>through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a<hr>free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do<hr>what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain<hr>circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently<hr>occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always<hr>holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater<hr>pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
